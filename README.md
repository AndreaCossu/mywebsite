# Ciao!

![Well, that's me!](.gitbook/assets/me-pontediavolo\_square\_small.jpg)

I am a **post-doc researcher** at the [Computer Science Department](https://di.unipi.it/en/)  of the [University of Pisa](https://www.unipi.it/index.php/english). \
I received my Ph.D. in Data Science from [Scuola Normale Superiore](https://www.sns.it/it) and University of Pisa. \
\
My research focuses on **Continual Learning.** I am interested in all kinds of learning environments where data changes over time. I have started working on Continual Learning by studying the behavior of Recurrent Neural Networks models in sequential data processing applications.

I am a member of the [**Pervasive AI Lab**](http://pai.di.unipi.it/) (University of Pisa and CNR) and of the [Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning (CIML)](https://ciml.di.unipi.it/) group at (University of Pisa).\
\
I am a Board Member and Treasurer of [**ContinualAI**](https://www.continualai.org/), a non-profit research organization and an open community of Continual/Lifelong Learning researchers and enthusiasts.\
I am one of the maintainers of [Avalanche](https://avalanche.continualai.org/), an End-to-End library for Continual Learning based on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

I was visiting researcher at KU Leuven (Belgium) and research intern at Google Brain, Mountain View (California). \
I received my Master's Degree in Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence Curriculum) from the University of Pisa.
