# Ciao!

![Well, that's me!](.gitbook/assets/me-pontediavolo\_square\_small.jpg)

I am a **PhD Student** in Data Science at [Scuola Normale Superiore](https://www.sns.it/it) and at the [Computer Science Department](https://www.sns.it) of [University of Pisa,](https://www.unipi.it/) under the supervision of Prof. [Davide Bacciu](http://pages.di.unipi.it/bacciu/), Dr.[ Vincenzo Lomonaco](https://www.vincenzolomonaco.com/) and Prof. [Anna Monreale](http://pages.di.unipi.it/amonreale/).\
\
My research focuses on **Continual Learning**, with applications to Recurrent Neural Networks models and sequential data processing.

I am a member of the [**Pervasive AI Lab**](http://pai.di.unipi.it/) (University of Pisa and CNR) and of the [Computational Intelligence and Machine Learning (CIML)](https://ciml.di.unipi.it/) group at (University of Pisa).\
\
I am a Board Member and Treasurer of [**ContinualAI**](https://www.continualai.org/), a non-profit research organization and an open community of Continual/Lifelong Learning researchers and enthusiasts.\
I am one of the maintainers of [Avalanche](https://avalanche.continualai.org/), an End-to-End library for Continual Learning based on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).
